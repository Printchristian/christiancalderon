        When I'm not diving into code or scribbling down my latest idea, you'll
        probably find me doing the following.
      </h1>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="./images/hiphop.jpg" alt="Music" />
        <p>
          Making music at home is one of my favorite ways to unwind and express
          myself. I don't need a fancy setup — just my laptop, some headphones,
          and the right vibe. It's my little space to create something out of
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes I'll spend hours layering sounds, tweaking beats, or just
          messing around until something clicks. There's no pressure, no rules —
          just me and the music. I love getting lost in that process.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>writing</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="./images/writing.jpg" />
        <p>
          I like writing stories, big or small. Some come from real life, others
          are pure imagination. Either way, I write what feels true.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see the scene in my mind first — like a movie already playing. It
          could be a moment, a line, or the whole movie that wants to come to
          life.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Predictive Sport Analysis</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="./images/ball.jpg" />
        <p>
          I like doing prop analysis — using stats to make over/under calls on
          player performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the feeling of being right after doing the research — like
          calling Luka Doncic to go over his PRA and watching it hit. It's not
          just guessing, it's trusting the numbers and your gut.
